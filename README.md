# Heart-Disease-Analysis
# 🩺 Heart Disease Risk Analysis using Healthcare Analytics  


## ⭐ **Project Overview**
This project focuses on analyzing a healthcare dataset to identify **common traits, patterns, and risk factors** that lead to **heart disease**.  
Using Python, the analysis includes:

- ✔️ Data Cleaning  
- ✔️ Univariate Analysis  
- ✔️ Bivariate Analysis  
- ✔️ Visualization Techniques  
- ✔️ Insight Generation  

The aim is to understand how demographic, lifestyle, and medical factors contribute to heart disease.

## 🧠 **1. What is Healthcare Analytics?**
Healthcare analytics involves using data to:

- 📊 Improve clinical decision-making  
- 🩺 Enhance patient outcomes  
- 🏥 Optimize hospital workflows  
- 🔍 Identify risk patterns and preventive strategies  

In this project, analytics is applied to uncover the **health and demographic traits** most associated with heart disease.

## 🧹 **2. Data Preparation & Cleaning**
Steps performed:

- ✨ Removed duplicates  
- ✨ Handled missing and inconsistent values  
- ✨ Encoded categorical variables  
- ✨ Standardized continuous variables  
- ✨ Created feature-target subsets  

This prepared the data for reliable statistical analysis and visualization.

## 📊 **3. Univariate Analysis**
Univariate analysis focuses on understanding **one variable at a time**.

### 🔍 Variables Explored:
- **Age**  
- **BMI**  
- **Mental Health Days (MentHlth)**  
- **Physical Health Days (PhysHlth)**  
- **HighBP**, **HighChol**, **Diabetes**, etc.

### 📈 Visualizations Used:
- Histograms  
- Bar Charts  
- Pie Charts  

### ⭐ Key Observations:
- **Age**: Most individuals fall between *35–65 years*.  
- **BMI**: Majority are *overweight or obese*.  
- **Medical Conditions**: High BP and high cholesterol are common.  
- **Heart Disease** appears in a smaller but significant portion of the population.

---

## 🔗 **4. Bivariate Analysis**
This stage explores how **two variables relate to each other**.

### 🔎 Analyses Conducted:

#### ⭐ a. Medical Factors vs Heart Disease  
- HighBP → 🔴 Strongly associated with heart disease  
- HighChol → 🔴 Strong correlation  
- Higher BMI → 🔼 Increased heart disease prevalence  

#### ⭐ b. Correlation Matrix  
- Age ↗ HeartDisease  
- HighBP ↗ HeartDisease  
- HighChol ↗ HeartDisease  

#### ⭐ c. Demographic Groups  
- Age 55+ → Highest heart disease cases  
- Males → Slightly higher prevalence  
- Lower education levels → Higher risk

## 📈 **5. Visualizations Used**
### 🟦 Categorical Plots:
- Bar charts  
- Pie charts  
- Grouped bar charts  
- Stacked bar charts  

### 🟩 Continuous Variable Plots:
- Histograms  
- Box plots  
- Violin plots  
- Line plots  

### 🟥 Relationship Visualizations:
- Scatter plots  
- Heatmaps  
- Pair plots  

These visualizations help understand distributions, relationships, and group differences.

## 📝 **6. Summary of Findings**
### 🔥 Top Insights Identified:
- **Age is the strongest demographic predictor.** Heart disease rises sharply after age 50.  
- **High Blood Pressure (HighBP)** is one of the most significant medical risk factors.  
- **High Cholesterol (HighChol)** strongly correlates with heart disease.  
- **Obesity (BMI)** increases heart disease risk.  
- **Low physical activity** shows higher heart disease prevalence.  
- **Smoking** contributes moderately to risk.  
- **Men have slightly higher heart disease cases** than women.  
- Lower educational attainment is associated with increased risk.

## 🧾 **7. Conclusion**
This project demonstrates how **Healthcare Analytics** can provide actionable insights by analyzing demographic, lifestyle, and medical variables.

Through data cleaning, univariate and bivariate analysis, and multiple visualization techniques, we identified **key risk factors** that contribute to the development of heart disease.  
These insights can support:

- 🩺 Preventive healthcare programs  
- 📈 Predictive modeling  
- 🏥 Better healthcare decision-making
